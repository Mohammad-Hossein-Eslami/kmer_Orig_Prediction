# üß¨ K-mer Frequency & Origin of Replication Detection in *E. coli*

This Jupyter Notebook analyzes DNA sequences to:
1. Compute **k-mer frequencies** and their **reverse complements**
2. Build a simple **de Bruijn graph**
3. Detect the **origin of replication (oriC)** region in *E. coli* using:
   - DnaA-box motif density
   - GC-skew analysis
   - Combined heuristic scoring
